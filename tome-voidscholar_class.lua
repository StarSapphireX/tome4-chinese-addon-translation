Void Scholars are dedicated spellcasters with poor durability, but many ways to negate damage and debilitate foes.

They use a unique resource called "Void Energy" that is built up by casting certain spells and quickly disperses when out of combat, requiring careful management to retain momentum.

Unique talent trees:
Logia (generic): Three forbidden chants to turn away slings, arrows, and everything else!
Void (generic): Render foes impotent before the majesty of the Void!
Vacuum: Draw upon the cosmic vacuum to replenish your resources!
Dilation: Pull space apart like putty to shred your foes!
Chaos: Crumble away your foes' defenses with the Void's power!
Collapse: Slowly crush enemies down to nothing under the Void's relentless weight!
Subspace: Ride and shape the Void to control the battlefield!
Dissolution: Dissolve away the material world to erode the strength of those who oppose you!
Genesis (locked): Repaint the world in your image to build overwhelming power!
Hyperspace (locked): Stretch and bend the universe to resculpt existence and unleash untold destruction!
Terminus (locked): Bring the slow, inevitable doom of the universe upon your foes!
